# Project Name

## Description
This project is to pull and store financial data from more obscure sources that main stream apps like Mint and Plaid will never make a connection for including giftcards, crypto wallets, miles, and points. It stores balance and transaction details in a database. There will be plans for a front end UI, but for now I plan to link to a chat bot so I can get my balance summary quickly on assets. 

This project is potentially optimizing views for the churning community.

## Features
- Connected to Blackhawk check balances of all stored cards and store balance details in database
- WIP: Connected to Blackhawk transactions, working on writing function to store transactions in seperate table
